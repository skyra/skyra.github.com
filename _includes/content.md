### Here's the problem I've noticed
The world would be a better, happier, more productive place if people were more open and transparent about the kinds of things they wanted to do. We would be able to get more things done by working together. We could share resources which we couldn't obtain otherwise. Things like [kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) exist for macro level projects, but there is nothing that exists to provide transparency on a lower level, from person to person.

### Here's where skyra comes in.
Sk√Ωra is the Icelandic word for clarity. My hope is that by opening up and documenting my goals here, I will achieve clarity in two ways. First, I will be thoroughly thinking through what I want to do and how I should do it. Second, people who have similar goals and who are looking for someone to collaborate with can more easily find me.

####*Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/skyra/skyra/issues) to see if anything interests you and [get in touch](https://plus.google.com/104703535905863588406).*

### Reasons why you *should* contact me
* You want to participate in one of my projects
* You have some project in mind and I can help
* You need my input on some project
* You are just bored and looking for something to do

### Reasons that *should not* stop you from contacting me
* We don't know each other well, or at all.
* You don't have any experience doing what you are interested in.
* You don't really know what you want to do.

####This is a proposition from me to you to collaborate. So what are you waiting for?

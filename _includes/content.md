### Here's the problem.
The world would be a better, happier, more productive place if people were more open and transparent about the kinds of things they wanted to do. We would be able to get more things done by working together. We could share resources which we couldn't obtain otherwise. Things like [kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) exist for macro level projects, but there is nothing that exists to provide transparency on a lower level, from person to person.

### Here's where skyra comes in.
Sk√Ωra is the icelandic word for clarity. My hope is that by opening up and documenting my goals, I will achieve clarity in two ways. First, I will be documenting and thinking through what I want to do and how I should do it. Second, I hope that other people who have similar goals and who are looking for someone to collaborate with can more easily find me.

_If you see anything here that even remotely interests you, I encourage you to take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/skyra/skyra/issues) or get in touch in another way. Even if you are just bored and looking for something to do. Even if we don't know each other well, or not at all. Even if you don't really know what you want to do. None of those things matter. This is a formal proposition from me to you to collaborate in any way you want. Especially if its something that interests you or furthers your goals in some way._

Come visit me! As my title says, I will be showing the tools and libraries I use to play with the kinect. I will also be showing the pieces I have created such as [Life as a Tree](/art/Life-of-a-Tree/) and [Kinect Force](/tech/processing/Kinect-Force/), as well as a few new things I have been working on. [Buy tickets here](http://makerfairenyc.eventbrite.com/) (Let me know if you are planning on going, I can probably get you a discounted ticket). I hope to see you there!

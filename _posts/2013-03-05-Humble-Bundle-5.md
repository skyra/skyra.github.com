I really love the [humble bundle](humblebundle.com) downloads. Especially the releases they have for Android. You can pay what you want and they are always worth what you pay. I haven't even gotten past the first game that I downloaded, [Super Hexagon](http://superhexagon.com/). You move the triangle between the edges in different styles of levels. Its such a simple game, but it is extremely fun and challenging.

Here is a quick trailer for the other games included in the bundle. Most of them look pretty fun!

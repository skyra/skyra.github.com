I'm in New York! Finally! I just moved here to work on android development at [Cornell NYC Tech](http://tech.cornell.edu). I'm part of an awesome team which is developing mobile health software.

I decided to start this blog to help foster collaboration between me and other interested individuals. Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/skyra/skyra/issues) to see the kinds of things I'm working on and the kinds of things I want to do. And help me out or work with me on any of them if you find them interesting.

I haven't listened to Mouse on Mars in ages, but they used to be one of my favorite bands. Mouse on Mars is a duo based out of Germany made up of Jan St. Werner and Andi Toma. They have been making electronic music since 1993. I was first introduced to them by an electronic music teacher I had while I was in high school. I instantly fell in love with the glitchy electronic sound they create. Two of my favorite songs are *Wipe That Sound* and *Duul*.

I randomly discovered Mouse on Mars would be playing in NYC the morning of the show. Luckily I didn't have any plans since I have been dying to seem them perform live for quite a long time. I wanted to see them perform the last time they toured the US 6 years ago, but wasn't able to. Talk about a long wait! The show started out with a set by Soft Circle, a local NYC group, with Hisham Bharoocha and Ben Vida. They had an interesting sound composed mostly of hardware synths and looping effects along with some looped vocals and triggered drums.

Then Mouse on Mars took the stage. They played a lot of new songs which I hadn't heard yet. I really need to get their new album to take a listen, but based on what I heard during they show, they seem to have merged their glitchy and quirky sound with electro style dance beats. They have always had a knack for integrating weird electronic sounds and effects with a more mainstream pop style.

Its been at least 6 years since I really listened to anything they made, but I really enjoyed the show overall. They had a very electronic feel, sort of like siman mobile disco, but a bit rougher at times. They used a lot of really cool effects and I really loved the vocals.

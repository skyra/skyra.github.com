title: Improv Final Show

The last improv classes basically consisted of us running through the show a bunch of times. Some of the times I felt amazingly good. Other times I was less sure. I think most of the good run throughs happened when I didn't second guess myself as much. I had an idea and went with it. Having a solid idea and playing it through completely is the most important thing to do. It doesn't even really matter what the idea is as long as it makes sense within the context of the scene.

For instance, in one scene during practice I "walked in on" two people who were making out in my garage. They started pretending they weren't doing anything and started to compliment me on how nice the garage was. Usually it is hard to play coy like that. It probably would have been better for them to just admit up front what they were planning to do in my garage. But I took the idea that my garage was pretty amazing as the game and started to show them around all the interesting things that I had done to the garage. Like how I installed hooks on the wall to hang my bikes, or the guidance system for parking my car. Eventually I had walk-on support where my wife came and started to show how cool our house was in general. It was pretty funny.

The show was really fun and I'm sad that my first improv class is over. I feel like I did reasonably well for my first time in front of a large group of people. Personally, I don't think I did quite as good as some of the practice sessions, but it wasn't bad at all. Some of the other members of my team had hilarious initiations for scenes. It was a lot of fun.

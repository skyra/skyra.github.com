I had my first improv lesson today taught by [UCB](www.ucbtheatre.com) here in New York. It was a little awkward, and I definitely didn't do that well. But what do you expect, I don't know what I'm doing, thats why I'm taking classes. I have a lot of room to improve!

We started out with a name game where we each said an adjective and our name out loud along with an action. I was Crazy Cameron and I spun my fingers around my head. It helped to match peoples names with an adjective and action. We played a few more games and then we got into the real work.

We learned two main things today. The first thing we learned was to use "yes and" rather than "no" or "yes but." Using "yes and" will always build upon the work of the scene that is already there. Its much harder to create an interesting scene when you constantly block the other person. We also learned that the best thing to do is define "who, what, and where" as soon as possible. Having a well defined scene makes interaction much easier.

We also learned to avoid questions and to avoid relationships which have no where to go, such as transaction scenes or teaching scenes. Questions aren't good because they leave too much undefined in the scene. We are the actors and we know where everything is. Transactions, like a salesman selling some item, end once the transaction is complete. It has no where else to go. Scenes like these can be saved if you focus more on the relationship of the two people rather than the transaction that is taking place, but for a beginner it is definitely hard.

I'm looking forward to the next class!

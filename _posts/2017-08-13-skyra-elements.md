excerpt: Control diy iot devices with google home
---

I'm starting to work on the beginning of a tool to help make controling diy IOT devices with google home a possibility. To control lights, I have emuluated a Phillips Hue hub, but it's very limiting. I'd like a way to build any device that google can potentially control (lights, thermostats, switches, outlets, scenes) and then just control it. Google requires you jump through a few hurdles like authentication in order to do it. I'm starting to work on [Skyra Elements](https://github.com/cketcham/skyra-elements) which is a combination of firebase functions and auth that should simplify the process of connecting devices to google home. More to come!

Each class I find that we get funnier and funnier. This class was by far the most funny and most fun. We started with pass the clap to warm up. Everyone stood in a circle. You would look into the eyes of the person next to you and clap at the same time. They would then take the clap and pass it to the next person. To make it more difficult, we could also clap back to the same person, or even clap across the circle to someone else. By the end, we had a few different claps going. It was important to be very aware of what was happening and to make sure you had eye contact between the people passing the clap.

We then started an exercise where two people would be sitting on a park bench just talking as if no one else was in the room. The idea was to be real. They were supposed to start with some real opinion or thought and then talk about the way they felt. I had more fun listening to my classmates talk as if no one was there than I did for any other exercise. It was really interesting and it showed the importance of just being truthful. It was hilarious listening to some of the things people were saying, but it was all true.

We then started to do some real scenes similar to what we are going to do during our show. We started from the suggestion and then did three monologues. From the suggestion or the monologues we then played out a few scenes. It was fast paced and fun!

We also practiced walk-ons. Once the game was established, we could walk on to support the characters and the game. We started a scene from the suggestion and then everyone had to walk on and do something to support the scene.

This class was the first time I feel like we were really putting our newfound skills to work. And I found I still need some practice on who, what and where. I'm better at going along with what the other person says rather than adding my own ideas. It's interesting because this is how I feel most of the time in my normal life. It is hard for me to add information to a conversation. I tend to freak myself out by worrying that I wont have enough time to think of something to say which causes me to be unable to think of something. It's kind of a vicious cycle.

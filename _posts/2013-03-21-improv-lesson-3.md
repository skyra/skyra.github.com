I had my third improv lesson today. This one was a great one! I can definitely see myself improving. I just let myself relax and think of things naturally as they came to me. The hardest problem I have is just letting go. I'm so worried I wont be able to think of anything that I get so anxious that I can't think of anything. I just need to relax. I found that if I sort of have a general idea of what I want to do, but nothing concrete, I am able to comfortably just think of things on the fly.

One of the ideas we learned which helped me get comfortable with a scene was the idea of A to C. A to C is when you take the audiences suggestion (A), find the first thing you think of (B) and then you think of the next thing off of B to get to C. C should be related, but not necessarily the same as A. For example you could go from "Jacuzzi", to "water jets", to "being on a jet." Its not actually related, but the audience will probably be able to pick up on your thought process and it increases the range of things that are possible in the scenes.

Another idea which really helped me let go was to clearly label the scene, myself, my partner, and what we are doing. This is something I definitely have to work on. During a scene, its hard for me to see what hasn't yet been labeled so I can label it. But when the scene is meticulously labeled, the characters actually have some place to go. It makes thinking of ideas much easier. 

Giving and receiving gifts is also very important. They help establish the scene just as much as a label. It is also important to fully accept a gift someone else gives you. If someone says "I noticed another woman's hair on your shirt!" a good way to reply is to just admit "yes I have been sleeping with my secretary." Its not easy to play coy or sarcastic since its hard to make that come across to the audience in a believable way.

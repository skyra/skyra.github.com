Even though I was sick I had to go to my improv lesson. They are surprisingly strict about absences since there is such a high demand for classes.

I can see myself improving, but this class definitely highlighted my main weakness. I can't 'And'. Whenever I am in a scene, it is hard for me to add any new information. I get too focused on what is happening and I add to that instead of adding new information to the scene such defining the relationship of the characters. And since I can't say 'no' or 'but' it generally just turns into me saying something along the lines of "yes, it was great when that happened. And here is some small other detail of what happened." Even though I know that in real life, people don't talk about what they are doing or what they did, they talk about other things.

This seems to happen in my normal life as well. I am bad at giving details. I generally only give details when I am prompted. I just don't think of those things on my own. And when I try to think of details under pressure, my mind just goes blank. I wish I could communicate better.

But there is a ray of hope. We practiced a scene where we had objects to work with. Although I was still slow coming up with new information to "and" with, I was able to do something. It is definitely much more of a struggle for me than other people, but I know that with practice I'll be able to get this down. And once I get this, I'll be able to come up with some really creative and interesting scenes.

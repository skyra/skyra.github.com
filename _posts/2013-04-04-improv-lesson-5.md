I had my fifth improv lesson today. I can't believe how quickly time is passing! Today we mainly worked on monologues since that is how we are going to generate scenes from the suggestion for our class performance. We started with an exercise where one person would stand in the middle of the circle and give a truthful monologue about a suggestion. Then people would tag in and start their own monologue based on what the previous monologue had made them think about. I found this exercise to be much easier than the singing exercise that we did a few weeks ago because I have a hard time remembering lyrics. Generally I listen more to the music when I hear a song and the lyrics just kind of go in the background. (Although I do know most of the lyrics for [Call Me Maybe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30Dldlfmr3U)).

We then went on to an exercise where four people went on stage. Two people painted a scene based on the suggestion and focused on providing information, almost like stage direction, about the objects that were in the scene. The more detailed the better, but it all had to make sense. Everything that was added to the scene had to make sense within the context of the first item which was added. The characters then had to act out a scene given what the location was like. This was our first introduction to "the Game."

The Game is basically the interesting or unusual part of a scene. In this first exercise, the game had to do with the location. What about this scene given the location was unusual. In one scene, the room was a disgusting bathroom. The bath tub was old and moldy, there was used toilet paper littering the ground and toothpaste all over the sink. The characters came in as two germaphobes who had never wanted to clean their bathroom, but decided it was time. The interesting and unusual thing in this scene was the fact that there were two germaphobes who were married and had let their bathroom get so bad there was no way they could function.

We worked more on the Game by doing two person scenes where we took a suggestion, found the first unusual thing and then used it as a pattern for the scene. For instance in one scene, a character was dying of a heart attack but his wife didn't care and was fed up that her husband didn't appreciate the fact that she cooked him dinner. In that case, the first unusual thing was the fact that she didn't care he was having a heart attack. They played off that unusual characteristic of the scene by re-enforcing the idea that she didn't care when he slumped against the wall. Our teacher called this a "straight man, crazy man" scene where one person is normal and the other person is crazy. It's interesting to me that both the straight man and the crazy man can play the game. In this scene, the man having the heart attack showed us that his wife didn't care by having increasingly severe symptoms which his wife could ignore. The wife played the game by ignoring her husband and even mocking him at one point by saying "And now the wheezing.. When will this end!"

We then worked on monologues. We got a suggestion and then told a truthful story about something it made us remember. The best monologues gave good details including peoples names, what they looked like, and how they behaved. These kinds of details make it easier to build scenes based on the monologues. The only scene which can come out of a story about someones boss, is a scene about a boss. However, there are more possibilities from a story about an overbearing boss, i.e. a scene about something that is overbearing, like an overbearing mother. This is a very simple example (the second story is not that much better), but because the monologue was more descriptive there were more possibilities for scenes.

A few tricks for monologues. The first is to A to C off other people's monologues so you don't end up with the same ideas. If two people take the same suggestion and tell very similar stories, the number of possible scenes will be limited. Instead, if one of the people A to Cs of the other persons monologue its more likely that the stories will be related, but different. The second trick is to lead the audience through your thought process. Its totally fine to say something like "The suggestion [insert suggestion here] makes me think of when I [insert thing here] which reminds me of my [insert something else here] because of [insert reason here], and that makes me think of [insert something else here]." That is a little bit of a long A to C, but it's a possibility.

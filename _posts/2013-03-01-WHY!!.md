Welcome to my piece for **[Bushwick First Friday](https://www.facebook.com/BushwickFirstFriday)**. The theme this month was Tangible Absence.

*Congratulations!* If you followed the [QR-code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qr_code), you found the one component of my display which actually functions correctly! Give yourself a pat on the back. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, this is what it looked like:

####Errors Galore
Everything else had some kind of problem or error. Don't you just hate when that happens? I had phones which couldn't connect to the internet, find a GPS signal, or just crashed for no reason. I also set up a comment system on a computer which would show the dreaded [bsod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bsod) occasionally. I hope you got a chance to play with them.

####My Idea
I started by thinking of the things that have the biggest impact in my life when they are absent. I immediately thought of my phone and computer. I require them to be connected to the things around me. I use Google Maps to get directions. I use Yelp to find places to eat. How did people survive before the internet?

####The Piece
In this piece, I tried to show what happens when technology goes wrong. Although technology can be helpful, when it's not working it makes things even more difficult to deal with. We have become so dependent on our phones that when they break, we are stuck trying to figure out how to fix it before we can move on to the thing we were trying to accomplish in the first place!

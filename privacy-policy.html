<p>Skyra Privacy Policy</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION TO PRIVACY AT SKYRA:</p>
<p>We at the Skyra Company (“Skyra”) know the value of trust and transparency, and we understand the need for responsible and secure protection of the information you choose to share with us. Your security and privacy are  important to us. Please read the following to learn more about our policies and practices for keeping your data secure.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>The Skyra website and all other products and Services, including mobile applications, owned, controlled or offered by Skyra, and all content offered as part thereof, are collectively referred to herein as the “Services.” Subscribers, account holders, customers, users, and others who download, access, use, and/or subscribe to the Services (“you”) agree to the following privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”).</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>By using or accessing our Services in any manner, you are acknowledging that you accept and are opting in to the practices and policies outlined in the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. By accessing the Services, you represent that you are over 13 years of age, and you hereby are giving full consent that Skyra will collect, use, and share your information as described below.</p>
<p>SKYRA PRIVACY POLICY</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of Aggregate de-identified data, Personal Information, and personally identifiable information that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>It does not extend to the practices of third party companies that you may choose to link to from the Skyra app.  We do not control or monitor the Services of third party companies, and their privacy practices will vary, so  we strongly encourage you to review the privacy statement and terms of use for any third-party service.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>THE INFORMATION SKYRA COLLECTS</p>
<p>Skyra gathers various types of Personal Information from our users for a variety of reasons. We use Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including as a means of identifying you as a Skyra subscriber, to personalize and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you, to track your preferences and settings, to provide and improve the Service, and to analyze how you use the Services. Certain information is required for the effective operation of the Services. These types of information are defined in the subparts below and used as described in the corresponding sections.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>The following sections explain what information we collect and how we use it.</p>
<p>a) Information provided to us by you:
We receive and store any information you voluntarily provide to us. For example, through the registration process, recording of your health data, and/or through your account settings, we may collect personal information such as your name, your email address, or your phone number. Certain information may be required to register with us, or to take advantage of some of the features within the Skyra application. Instant messages, emails, contact requests and other forms of communication are kept private and confidential.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>b) Information collected automatically when using our Services
Whenever you interact with our Service, Skyra will automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. If you click on a link to a third party website or Service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. As described below, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>c) Information collected from other websites 
Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>d) Enabling the “Do Not Track” Feature on your browser
Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and Services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites. When you turn on the Do Not Track function in your browser, we stop collecting the information from your browser that allows us to tailor advertisements and other content specifically to you that is based on your visits to our advertising partners’ websites. Specifically, we stop collecting information from the unique browser cookie that links your browser to visits to third party sites. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked. Remember that this is just our Do Not Track policy, and we can’t and don’t make any promises about how third parties respond when you set this signal on your browser. Not all third parties will allow you to opt out of tracking or cookies.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>e) Geo-tracking
The Skyra app may use the built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) and location capabilities built into your device. This data may be used to track your location as well as the length of your stay at appointments, and may enable you to check into required locations as a part of ongoing treatment.  You can choose whether this feature is enabled on your device. Please note that if you choose to turn off the location capabilities on your phone you will not be able to benefit from some of the features of this application. The Application will log that the user has disabled tracking.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>f) Other Features</p>
<p>Skyra will not access your camera, your contacts, your location, or any other device content without your permission.</p>
<p>HOW WE USE YOUR DATA</p>
<p>Skyra uses the information you provide to us to personalize and improve your experience with our services. Sometimes our healthcare partners may  need to access these data in order to partner with us effectively. The following sections explain how the data we collect are employed.</p>
<p>a) Identifiable data</p>
<p>Skyra will not share information about you in personally identifiable form with anyone outside of our partners.</p>
<p>However, de-identified information can provide valuable insights into the efficacy and quality of our product. In the interest of maintaining the highest standards, we may share information with third parties as described below:</p>
<p>b) Aggregated Anonymized Data: 
The term “Anonymized Data” refers to information that is no longer associated with a specific individual. “Aggregate Data” are data that describe groups or populations as opposed to individuals. Skyra may use, reproduce, sell, publicize, or otherwise exploit Aggregate Data in any way, in its sole discretion. Anonymized data can be used to improve user experience and application efficacy by giving us insights into the demographics and behaviors of our users. We may de-identify or anonymize your personal information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We also may combine your de-identified information with that of other users to create aggregate de-identified data that may be disclosed to third parties who may use such information to understand and analyze our Services. These data will not contain individual identifiers, nor will any constellation of information be collated which can identify an individual.</p>
<p>c) Third-Party partners</p>
<p>Skyra’s partners are businesses such as treatment centers, insurance companies, technology providers with whom we have non-disclosure agreements or Business Associates Agreements to protect your data. Our partners may provide Services to you through or in connection with the Skyra Services (either alone or jointly with Skyra ). We will share your Personal Information with that Partner only to the extent that it is related to your care. </p>
<p>d) Social Media</p>
<p>Skyra will also never contact others or post to social networks on your behalf without your permission</p>
<p>COMMUNICATION WITH SKYRA</p>
<p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers opportunities to participate in research studies, or email you about your use of the Services. These offers are independent of the Service the application provides, and your participation will not affect your receipt of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Services, and is in no way associated with your receipt of the Services.  If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at info@Skyra.com . </p>
<p>​</p>
<p>SECURITY AT SKYRA</p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is collected, applied and stored in the securest manner.  We have implemented a variety of commercially standard encryption and security technologies and procedures to protect your personal information stored by us from unauthorized access.  We also maintain standard physical and electronic procedural safeguards that limit access to your personal information to our employees (or people working on our behalf and under confidentiality agreements) who, through the course of standard business activities, will need to access your personal information.</p>
<p>Information stored or transferred electronically is never completely secure, so while we at Skyra do our best to protect you and your privacy, please be aware that absolute security cannot be guaranteed by Skyra.</p>
